I don’t see how learning styles really change my learning. I always learn best when I care about the topic or when my teacher inspires me. When starting college my whole motivation for school and learning has switched. I think learning is not a style but a practice. Teachers can be our coaches but it is only when we practice, stretch, and train on our own and in our own way through trial and error do we really learn how to learn.
